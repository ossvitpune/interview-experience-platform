## Project Overview

The **Interview Experience Platform** is a web-based application designed specifically for students of VIT Pune. It aims to bridge the information gap faced by students preparing for job placements and internships by providing a dedicated platform to share, discover, and learn from real-world **interview and test experiences** of their peers. This hub will serve as a vital resource, fostering a collaborative environment for better preparation and increased confidence.

---

## Problem Statement

The current placement preparation process for VIT Pune students is fragmented and inefficient. Without a centralized, reliable source of interview and test experiences, students are forced to gather information from scattered, often outdated, and unverified sources like social media, private chats, and generic forums. This leads to unnecessary stress, redundant effort in searching for information, and a lack of targeted preparation, ultimately hindering their performance and reducing their chances of securing desirable placements.

    * Personal advice and preparation tips
    * Option to post anonymously for candid feedback.
* **Centralized Experience Repository:** All submitted experiences are displayed on a central dashboard, easily accessible to all registered users.
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Robust search functionality with filters for company, role, year of placement, and keywords, enabling students to quickly find relevant information.
